        <p class="section-paragraph">The RabbitMQ Message Broker is the heart of the Sepia architecture. It routes all event messages from authors to recipients. The RabbitMQ Message Broker is implemented by <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>, <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html">version 3.7.0</a> or later. RabbitMQ is a widely deployed open source message broker and completely independent from the Eiffel community. In other words, there is no Eiffel specific message broker implementation. Instead, Sepia lists a small number of requirements on RabbitMQ servers and clients.</p>

        <h1 class="section-heading">Server Requirements</h1>
        <p class="section-paragraph">The RabbitMQ Message Broker SHALL use RabbitMQ version 3.7.0 or later.</p>
        <p class="section-paragraph">Note that Sepia places no requirements on deployment architecture (e.g. distributed or not), authentication enforcement or exchange configuration. These aspects of the message broker are up to the demands in each specific case.</p>
